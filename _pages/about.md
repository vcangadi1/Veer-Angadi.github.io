I am a Research Fellow in the Systems Engineering Research Group (SERG) @ Brunel University London. My expertise are on Industrial IoT - statistical inferences, machine learning, data analytics, data mining in Industry 4.0 environment, image/video coding, computer visions, multi/hyperspectral analysis in the transmission electron microscopy (TEM/STEM) and related domain. I am also involved in design & development of user applications for interactive technical tasks. I have interests in working and designing with microcontrollers such as Arduino, Raspberry Pie, MSP430, eZ430-RF2500 etc. 

I am currently involved in an EU funded Horizon 2020 ([H2020](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en)) FoF [Z-BRE4K](https://www.z-bre4k.eu/) project (grant agreement No. 768869) to investigate and predict the sudden breakdowns in the high value manufacturing machines by incorporating artificial intelligence in the manufacturing process.

I have an open source MATLAB working repository & analytical routines on electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) called [EELSAnalyser](https://github.com/vcangadi1/EELSAnalyser) (contributors are welcome!).
