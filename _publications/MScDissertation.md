The proposed design of video summarization is done by including a sense of feedback in terms of quality of experience from the user. The summarization of the video is done by considering energy associated with the consecutive frame difference. The project exploits the fact that if the energy is very low, it indicates that the motion associated between  the frames is less. The maximum threshold for the energy is obtained by the novel numerical mathematical model. The feedback is incorporated in terms of altering the value of the threshold. The project also discusses and analyse the different application associated with proposed video summarization algorithm.
