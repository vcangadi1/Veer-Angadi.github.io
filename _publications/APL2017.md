Analytical scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) has been applied to study aluminium nitride (AlN) doped with terbium (Tb) and annealed at 800◦C. Correlation of the
maps of Tb and oxygen (O) from electron energy-loss spectrum (EELS) imaging proves that these two elements co-segregate, replacing aluminium (Al) and nitrogen (N) atoms, respectively. This agrees well with modelling which predicted the existence of Tb−O complexes needed to fit all lines in the rather complicated cathodoluminescence (CL) emission spectrum of the sample.
